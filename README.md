# Discord Bot using Python
A simple bot in your Discord server that keep tracks of messages and people joining.

## Installation

`$ pip install requirement.txt`

You need to replace the `token.txt` file with your own **TOKEN** and within the main bot script, your `client.get_guild(ID)` needs to be changed as well. The script needs to be run manually everytime to have the BOT be online.

You could also use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) service to host the bot online.
